## Product Vision
Our mission is simple yet powerful: to give the general public the opportunity to make a difference in the world. This is how ReBrand was born. An app where you can donate clothes that you no longer use in an intuitive and simple way. Through the app they will be resold and all the funds will revert to a Charity foundation of your choice. If no unused clothes are lying around your closet, donating funds to the organizations that you prefer is also an option.

ReBrand’s goal is to inherit the characteristics of fast fashion such as easy shopping and cheap prices. in a more morally and environmentally friendly way. The focus is on thrifting and giving old clothes life, so we don't burden the environment with water pollution and tons of unrecyclable residues. With your donations and in cooperation with charities we'll make fast fashion a second choice for everyone.
