## Vertical Prototype

So far, we have implemented the initial page of the app, where the user can choose between two operations: Shopping or Donating. Currently, only the Shopping option is available. When the user selects to Shop with ReBrand, the app redirects to the Shopping Page, where the user can scroll and explore the available options. However, at this stage, no clothes are available, users can only scroll and select one of the cards, then return to the main page.

Here is  a small video demonstrating the features implemented so far:
